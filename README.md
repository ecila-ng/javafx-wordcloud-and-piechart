# javafx-wordcloud-and-piechart
üå∫ Another simple GUI with (pink) word cloud and pie chart ‚òÅÔ∏è

This application is a live updating word cloud and pie chart. The system should allow a user to:
- Enter in a new word from a text box embedded in the application and have that word show up in the word cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
- The word should also appear in a pie chart to the right of the word cloud
- Cick on any added word, either in the word cloud or in the pie chart of the added words will grow that word for 2 points‚ú®
- Clear all existing words by clicking 'Clear All' button. A confirmation pop-up will appear.
- Quit the  application by clicking 'Quit' button. A confirmation pop-up will appear.

List of user interface functionality:
- The 'Add' button should allow the user to type in a new word made up of only characters and digits, and add that word into the word cloud. If the word is already in the cloud, the corresponding word in the cloud will increase its font size by two points. If such an increase causes the word to overlap any other words, the word should be moved to a location where it does not overlap any others.
- The 'Clear All' button will remove all words from the pie chart and the word cloud, also reset the text field.
